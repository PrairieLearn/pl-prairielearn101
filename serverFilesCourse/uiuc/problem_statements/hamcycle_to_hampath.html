    A <em>Hamiltonian cycle</em> in a graph is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.
    Similarly, a <em>Hamiltonian path</em> in a graph is a path that visits every vertex exactly once.
</p>

<p>Consider the following two decision problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>HAM-CYCLE:</b>
        Given an <em>undirected</em> graph $G$, decide whether or not it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>HAM-PATH:</b>
        Given an <em>undirected</em> graph $G$, decide whether or not it contains a Hamiltonian path.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Suppose we already know that <b>HAM-CYCLE</b> is NP-Hard,
    and we want to prove that <b>HAM-PATH</b> is NP-Hard.
