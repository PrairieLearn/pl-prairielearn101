  <p> In the following circuit, the GPIO pin is configured in output mode, and will be set HIGH to turn the LED on.</p>

            <pl-figure file-name="schematic.svg"></pl-figure>

	    <p>The datasheet for the LED is: 
	    <pl-file-download file-name="{{params.datasheet}}" directory="clientFilesQuestion" force-download="false"></pl-file-download>
	   </p>

	   <p>Refer to the datasheet to find key parameters of the LED: the typical forward voltage (or minimum forward voltage, if a typical number is not given) and the recommended maximum <i>continuous</i> current.<p>
	   <p>Then, choose the resistor that will make the LED shine as brightly as possible <i>without exceeding the recommended maximum continuous current</i> AND <i>without drawing more than 15mA from the GPIO pin</i>. The following resistors are available for you to choose from: {{params.r1}}立, {{params.r2}}立, or {{params.r3}}立.</p>
