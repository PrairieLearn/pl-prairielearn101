   <p>You are using a 10-segment {{params.color}} LED bar graph. The LED bar graph is a part with 10 LEDs arranged in a single package.</p>
   <p>The datasheet for the LED bar graph is:
   <pl-file-download file-name="{{params.datasheet}}" directory="clientFilesQuestion" force-download="false"></pl-file-download>
  <p>You connect your Pi to the LED bar graph, so that BCM pins 16, 12, 7, 8, 25, 24, 23, 18, 15, 14 are connected (through a series resistor) to the anodes of the LED segments, from the bottom to top of the bar graph.</p>

  <pl-figure file-name="led-bargraph-1_bb.svg" width="100%"></pl-figure>

 <p>You write a function <code>setup_pins</code> to configure the GPIO pins connected to your bar graph, and a function <code>write_bar</code> to make it display a "bar" with the bottom <code>k</code> bars lit.</p>
 <pl-code language='python' source-file-name='code.py'>
</pl-code>

<p><i>Hint:</i> In case you are unfamiliar with Python's slice notation, here's an example to show you how it works:</p>
<pl-code language='python'>
l = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
l[:2] # output will be [0, 1]
l[2:] # output will be [2, 3, 4, 5]
</pl-code>

<p>When you try to test your work by running</p>

<pl-code language='python'>
setup_pins(PINS)
write_bar(PINS, 8)
time.sleep(5)
write_bar(PINS, 4)
</pl-code>

<p>it seems to work on the first call to <code>write_bar</code> (the bottom 8 bars are lit). But after the second call to <code>write_bar</code>, you still see 8 bars lit, not 4 as expected.</p>

<p>Modify <code>write_bar</code> so that the bottom <i>k</i> bars (and only those bars) are lit following a call to <code>write_bar</code>.</p>
