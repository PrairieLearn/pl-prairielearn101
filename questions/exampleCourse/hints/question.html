This question shows how the standard `pl-hint` element can be setup to give a hint to students that need it.

*Note that there is currently no functionality to reduce `credit` if a hint is used.
This is probably for the best because there is some research that suggests penalizing students for using hints hampers learning.
That said, the suggested way to handle this is to provide [diminishing points](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#limiting-the-number-of-attempts-for-each-question) for each subsequent attempt.*

Think about what we learned in Week 2 about how to add numbers. [Here's a link to the slides](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/early-math#cc-early-math-add-sub-basics).

Actually, perhaps you should just watch this YouTube video:

<pl-video-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AuX7nPBqDts"></pl-video-embed>

**Note: The video is embedded using a customized element called `pl-video-embed` that is not yet available as a default element.
In order to use it, you should copy the folder `elements/pl-video-embed` into your course (if the `elements` directory doesn't exist, you can create it).
This is how you can create your own customized elements!
