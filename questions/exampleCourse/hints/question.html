This question shows how the standard `pl-hint` element can be setup to give a hint to students that need it.

*Note that there is currently no functionality to reduce `credit` if a hint is used.
This is probably for the best because there is some research that suggests penalizing students for using hints hampers learning.*

Actually, perhaps you should just watch this YouTube video:
