Questions below were designed to showcase the different features of [`pl-hidden-hints`](http://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/#pl-hidden-hints-element).
The goal of the [`pl-hidden-hints`](http://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/#pl-hidden-hints-element) element is to progressively show hints as students submit incorrect (but not invalid) answers.
You should submit incorrect answers to see how the hints are shown.

*Note: Newly revealed hints are first shown as open.*
