<p> Given two integer arrays of the same length, find the <b>number of differences</b> in the two arrays. A difference in the array is when at the same index value in the arrays, the integers values differ. </p> 

<p> For example, [1,2,3] and [1,2,4] have 1 difference at index 2 since 3 is not equal to 4.</p> 

<p> @paramter: r0 address to first int array </p> 
<p> @paramter: r1 address to second int array </p> 
<p> @paramter: r2 the length of the arrays (positive number) </p> 
<p> @return: in r0, the number of different values in the array   </p> 

<p> You may assume that registers r3 - r6 have already been initialized to values of 0. </p> 

<p> Arrange code to be efficient (Hint: this means at the beginning of the loop, a comparison to the end should be present. </p>
