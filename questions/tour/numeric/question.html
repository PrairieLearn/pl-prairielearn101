<p>For floating point numeric inputs, where the number of digits after the decimal place is specified, you can either: </p>
<ul>
    <li>enter <i>more</i> digits than are required (and then you won't have to round your answer), </li>
    <li>or round (don't concatenate!) your answer so to the specified number of digits (following the rule: digits 0 through 4 round down, digits 5 through 9 round up).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the answer to this question is <tt>2/3</tt> (but as a decimal, not a ratio). </p>

<p>This is a valid answer - supplying more digits than required:</p>
<pl-code language="text">
0.6666666
</pl-code>


<p>This is a valid answer - rounding (not truncating!) to four digits after the decimal place:</p>
<pl-code language="text">
0.6667
</pl-code>


<p>But, this answer (truncating to four digits after the decimal place) would not be valid:</p>
<pl-code language="text">
0.6666
</pl-code>

<p>When you are working on a problem with multiple computations that build on one another, rounding errors can propagate and get bigger through the sequence of computations. To avoid this, you should always keep <i>more</i> decimal places in your computation than are expected in your submitted answer.</p>
