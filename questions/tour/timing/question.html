There are some questions where you can submit an answer for grading more than once, but with a wait time between submissions.
The purpose of this is to ask you to think more deeply about the question (if you don't get it wrong on the first try), rather than trying to brute force the answer.
In this example, you have to wait one minute (60 seconds) between graded attempts.

*Note: You can still save your answer with the "Save" button, even when the "Save and Grade" button is unavailable because of the wait time.*
If the assignment deadline passes before you can "Save and Grade" again, your last saved submission will automatically be graded.

**I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. What's the number?**
