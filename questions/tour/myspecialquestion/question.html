For floating point numeric inputs, where the number of digits after the decimal place is specified, you can either:

- enter *more* digits than are required (and then you won't have to round your answer),
- or round (don't concatenate!) your answer so to the specified number of digits (following the rule: digits 0 through 4 round down, digits 5 through 9 round up).

For example, the answer to this question is `2/3` (but as a decimal, not a ratio).

This is a valid answer - supplying more digits than required:

```python
for i in range(6):
    print(i)
```

<pl-code language="python">
for i in range(6):
    print(i)
</pl-code>

```
0.6666666
```

This is a valid answer - rounding (not truncating!) to four digits after the decimal place:

```
0.6667
```

But, this answer (truncating to four digits after the decimal place) would not be valid:
```
0.6666
```

When you are working on a problem with multiple computations that build on one another, rounding errors can propagate and get bigger through the sequence of computations. To avoid this, you should always keep <i>more</i> decimal places in your computation than are expected in your submitted answer.
