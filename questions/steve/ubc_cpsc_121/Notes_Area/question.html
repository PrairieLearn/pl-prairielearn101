<p>
    This is a sample of a question to use to enable student notetaking. You could
    also allow students to use their own text editor locally (either on their own
    computer or on a computer-based testing facility computer, if that's allowed).
    However, there may be advantages to keeping everything inside 
    PrairieLearn/PrairieTest, e.g., simplifying proctoring instructions. While you
    could also use the 
    <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#student-attached-personal-notes">
        <samp>allowPersonalNotes</samp> option
    </a>, that essentially also requires students to use their own editor, since
    once they enter text, re-opening it is via an external application.
</p>
<p>
    When using this question, we recommend putting it in a zone of its own in the assessment.
    It must be worth 0 points. (Students <em>cannot</em> earn any marks on this question.)
</p>
<p>
    This question enables:

    <ul>
        <li>Students can take arbitrary textual notes within an assessment.</li>
        <li>Students can save (but not grade) and review previous saved versions.</li>
        <li>Editing continues to be possible until the assessment is closed.</li>
        <li>Students can review these notes any time they are able to review problems on the assessment.</li>
        <li>Staff can review these notes any time after they are saved (but note that we explicitly forbade
            use of these notes in grading in our own course).</li>
    </ul>
</p>
