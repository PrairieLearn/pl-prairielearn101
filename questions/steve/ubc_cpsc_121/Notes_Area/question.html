    <p><strong>Nothing on this "Question" is necessary or graded as part of the exam. 
        No grade above 0% is possible on this "Question".</strong></p>

    <p>We provide a textbox below for any scratch notes you want to
    take during this assessment for your own reference. <em>Nothing in
    these notes will ever be used in any way in grading.</em></p>
    
    <p>You can use the <samp>Save only</samp> button to save your scatch work.
    The <samp>Save & Grade</samp> button <em>will not work</em>, however.</p>

    <p>If you would like to open the rest of the assesment in a new tab while leaving
    this page available for access: Hold down Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) and 
    then click the "Assessment overview" button.</p>
