This is a sample of a question to use to enable student notetaking. You could also allow students to use their own text editor locally (either on their own computer or on a computer-based testing facility computer, if that's allowed). However, there may be advantages to keeping everything inside PrairieLearn/PrairieTest, e.g., simplifying proctoring instructions. While you could also use the [allowPersonalNotes option](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#student-attached-personal-notes), that essentially also requires students to use their own editor, since once they enter text, re-opening it is via an external application.

When using this question, we recommend putting it in a zone of its own in the assessment.  
It must be worth 0 points. (Students *cannot* earn any marks on this question.)

This question enables:

- Students can take arbitrary textual notes within an assessment.
- Students can save (but not grade) and review previous saved versions.
- Editing continues to be possible until the assessment is closed.
- Students can review these notes any time they are able to review problems on the assessment.
- Staff can review these notes any time after they are saved (but note that we explicitly forbade use of these notes in grading in our own course).
