    This is a sample of an attendance question. The correct answer changes every minute and expires
    five minutes later (but both are configurable in <samp>server.py</samp>). Course staff can see
    the current correct answer by clicking <samp>Save only</samp> or <samp>Save & Grade</samp> and 
    then expanding the <samp>Show/Hide answer</samp> tree in the  yellow 
    <samp>Staff information</samp> panel on the right.

<p>
    If you use this in your course, we recommend relocating <samp>timehash.py</samp> and 
    <samp>wordlist.py</samp> to <samp>serverFilesCourse</samp>. You may also want to modify
    the word list or use your own. The existing one is hopefully-inoffensive and based on
    Wikipedia's simple word list. However, a small minority of words we kept were reasonable 
    to expect students to know and spell in an introductory logic and circuits course and will 
    be less so in other course contexts! We also recommend giving two full-credit attempts to
    minimize the impact of miscommunication or typos on course staff and so TAs using the question
    in student view can still view the correct answer.
