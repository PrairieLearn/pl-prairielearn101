The mean, median, and mode of a dataset are useful starting points for understanding the characteristics of a dataset, but they are single numbers that describe the average, middle, and most common values (the central tendencies) of the dataset.

**Variance** and **standard deviation** are measures that tell us how "spread out" a dataset is. The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance. 

Here is a histogram (or **distribution**) of data that is more *narrow* - more of the data points are grouped around a central value (0 in this case):

<pl-figure file-name="VarStdDev_1.png" directory="clientFilesQuestion" width="600px" alt="A histogram of a dataset. The variance is 0.5537 and the standard deviation is 0.7440."></pl-figure>

Here is a histogram of data that is more *wide* - more of the data points are farther away from a central value (0 in this case): 

<pl-figure file-name="VarStdDev_2.png" directory="clientFilesQuestion" width="600px" alt="A histogram of a dataset. The variance is 2.1975 and the standard deviation is 1.4824."></pl-figure>

The more narrow distribution's variance is smaller than the wider distribution's variance. Similarly, the more narrow distribution's standard deviation is smaller than the wider distribution's standard deviation. *Therefore, the smaller the variance (or standard deviation), the more narrow the distribution will be.* 

Important things to note when we compare these two figures:

- The x-axes have the same limits, and the y-axes have the same limits. This allows us to directly compare the data visually.
- These figures also have the same underlying "type" of data (normally-distributed random numbers), allowing us to directly compare the variance and standard deviation when we state, "This variance is smaller than that variance." (Comparing the variance of the height of a blade of grass to the variance of the top speed of cheetahs makes no sense.)
- Variance and standard deviation only offer an aggregate measure of the spread of a dataset. It's often important to consider the shape of the distribution as well (e.g. is it a bell curve or a uniform distribution?).

MATLAB has built-in functions to calculate the variance and standard deviation:

- `var` - variance
- `std` - standard deviation

These functions work similarly to all the other built-in functions that calculate statistical measures of a data set (e.g. `max`, `mean`, etc.)


<pl-info-box type="warning">

If you want to take the variance (or standard deviation) of all elements in a matrix `M`, don't use `var(var(M))` - that's not correct because the variance of the column variances is not mathematically equivalent to the variance of the whole dataset. Instead, use either of the other approaches, `var(M(:))` or `var(M, 0, 'all')` (the `0` is a weighting value; you can look up the `var` function in the MATLAB documentation to learn more).
