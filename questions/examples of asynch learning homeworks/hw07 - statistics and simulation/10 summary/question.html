This is the end of this homework assignment! Here is a summary of what we covered in this assignment: 



* **MATLAB is often used to analyze data.** We tend to follow a similar pattern each time: Read data in from a file, look for some characteristics/process the data, and plot the data to see trends, patterns, extremes, etc.

* MATLAB has built-in functions for calculating common statistical measures of datasets: `mean` (average), `median`, `mode`, `var` (variance), and `std` (standard deviation).

* The `histogram` function will generate a histogram of a vector of data; if you need the number of occurrences in each bin, use the `histcounts` function.

* Error bars can be used to convey a range of values for each point on the plot or uncertainty about a measured value. MATLAB's `errorbar` function will create a plot with “error bars” at each data point.

* **MATLAB is also used to simulate data.** When we simulate data, we also tend to follow a similar pattern each time: Convert the math equations into a computer program, create a starter set of data and use the computer program from step 1 to generate  predicted data, and look for some things / process data / plot data to see trends, etc.

* The `linspace` function can be used to generate equally spaced values, similar to the range operator (`:`), to be used as a starter set of data. 

* MATLAB can also generate random values to be used as a starter set of data. The `randi` function generates pseudorandom integers from a uniform discrete distribution.
