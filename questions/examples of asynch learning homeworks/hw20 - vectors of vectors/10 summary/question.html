This is the end of this homework assignment! Here is a summary of what we covered in this assignment: 



* We can created nested vectors (or **vectors of vectors**), which are useful for storing matrix data. When working with a vector of vectors, make sure to keep track of whether you are working with the *inner* vector or the *outer* vector.

* To index into a vector of vectors, you need to index twice - once for the inner vector and once for the outer vector. For example, `vec[0][1]` or `vec.at(0).at(1)`.

* Use a doubly-nested loop to print out a vector of vectors (or to iterate through a vector of vectors, more generally).

* If we are representing a matrix with a vector of vector, each vector represents a row. Elements within represent different columns.

* We practiced writing helper functions and putting them into a module with the `analyzeData` module.
