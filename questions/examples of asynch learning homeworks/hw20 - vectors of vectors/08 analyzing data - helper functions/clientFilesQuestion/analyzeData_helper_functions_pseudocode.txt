This is the pseudocode we wrote for the four helper functions we need to write for the analyzeData module.



void loadData(vector of vectors, input stream from file) { 
   
  get number of rows from vector of vectors
  get number of columns from vector of vectors
  
  make a temporary variable to store numbers in from >> operator

  loop on outer vector
    loop on inner vector
      read a number from input stream
      store that number in the correct element of the vec of vecs
    end of loop on inner vector
  end of loop on outer vector

}



void sumOfRows(vector of vectors, vector) { 
   
  traverse the outer vector to go through each row one by one
    traverse the inner vector 
      use the "accumulator" pattern to find the sum of each row
    end of loop on inner vector
  end of loop on outer vector
  
}





void sumOfCols(vector of vectors, vector) { 
   
  traverse an inner vector to go through each column one by one
    traverse the outer vector 
      use the "accumulator" pattern to find the sum of each column
    end of loop on outer vector
  end of loop on inner vector

}




int sum(vector of vectors) { 
   
  traverse the outer vector to go through each row one by one
    traverse the inner vector 
      use the "accumulator" pattern to find the total sum
    end of loop on inner vector
  end of loop on outer vector
  
  return sum of all elements

}
