  <p> Suppose the following TCP ACK is received by a host running a TCP service:</p>
  <pl-code language="text">
{{params.server}}.{{params.sport}} > {{params.client}}.{{params.cport}}: 
    Flags [.], ack {{params.ack}}, win 6227, length 0</pl-code>
</pl-question-panel>

<p>Before it received that ACK, the host sent all of the following TCP segments. Which of these can it conclude were received by the other endpoint? Select all that apply.</p>
