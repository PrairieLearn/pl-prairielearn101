  <p>A TCP Reno sender has:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>MSS={{params.mss}} bytes,</li>
      <li>{{params.buffer}} bytes in its send buffer that have not yet been sent,</li>
      <li>{{params.inflight}} bytes sent but not yet ACKed,</li>
      <li>CWND={{params.cwnd}} bytes,</li>
      <li>and advertised RWND={{params.awnd}} bytes.</li>
     </ul>
</pl-question-panel>

  <p>How many bytes of data (potentially split across multiple segments!) will it send from its buffer?</p>

<p>The sender in this scenario is application-limited - the limiting factor is not CWND or RWND, but rather the rate at which the application adds data to the send buffer.</p><p>It can send {{params.buffer}} bytes.</p>

<p>The sender in this scenario is CWND-limited - it has plenty of data to send, and the receiver has space in its receive buffer, but the sender is restricted by CWND.</p><p>It can send {{params.cwnd}} - {{params.inflight}} bytes.</p>

<p>The sender in this scenario is RWND-limited - it has plenty of data to send, and it is allowed to send more data according to CWND, but the receiver is not prepared to receive much data.</p><p>It can send {{params.awnd}} - {{params.inflight}} bytes.</p>
