    We'll start with comparing how the list of responsibilities we devised at the start
    are divided between classes in Design A vs Design B. In answering these questions,
    use the UML diagrams as well as the code for your reference.

                Although this type of question requires some interpretation of what cohesion means in this context,
                we can think about how many responsibilities are placed on any single class. Design A gives
                WaitTimesCalculatorA many responsibilities outside its purpose of being a calculator - such as
                getting information about factors. Design B, on the other hand, limits its responsibilities as much as
                possible, being more focused and cohesive.
