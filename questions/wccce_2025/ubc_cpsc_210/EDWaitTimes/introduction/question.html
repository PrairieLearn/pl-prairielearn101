        In this lab, you will be working on an analysis tool that will help us
        find some interesting trends in emergency room wait times. In British
        Columbia, many emergency rooms publish wait time information every 5
        minutes on <a href="https://edwaittimes.ca/">edwaittimes.ca</a>, and 
        we collected a sample of several weeks of this data to analyse. With this data, you will create
        a tool that will help us explore how wait times are affected by
        different factors. An example of question we want to answer is
        "How are wait times affected by the day of the week?" where the factor is
        the day of the week.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll do this by grouping the wait times records by
        some factor. An example group for day of the week would be "Sunday".
        We will then compare the averages across all groups by producing a bar chart.
        So far, we are only interested in seeing how wait times differ
        by day of the week, but we may want to add more in the future.
    </p>

    <h4>List of Responsibilities</h4>

    <p>
        In terms of things we need our code to do, we can break it down into a few responsibilities:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Representing all the factors that this tool can group wait times by

                <ul>
                    <li>For example: by day of week, hour of day, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Getting information about factors

                <ul>
                    <li>For example: finding the name/label of a factor (e.g. <code>"Day of week"</code>)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Getting all the possible groups for a given factor

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For example, for our first factor (day of week),
                        all the possible groups are the days of the week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Finding the group for a given wait time record</li>
            <li>Putting a wait time record into its group</li>
            <li>Finding the average of these groups of wait times</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        We have come up with two designs for this project, and we want to compare them based on how they will
        support our plans going forward. You can see the UML diagrams for both of these designs below:
    </p>

    <h4>UML Diagrams</h4>

    <p>
        <b>Design A:</b>
        <pl-figure file-name="DesignA.png" directory="clientFilesQuestion"></pl-figure>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Design B:</b>
        <pl-figure file-name="DesignB.png" directory="clientFilesQuestion"></pl-figure>
    </p>

    <p>
        Both of these designs accomplish the responsibilities we set out above, but these responsibilities are
        divided into different classes between the two of them. In this lab, we want to work with these two designs, and
        to be able to compare them.
    </p>

    <h4>Setup</h4>

    <p>
        This lab takes some organization and methodological thinking. To get set up to work on this lab, you should have
        these pages open to easily go between:

        <ul>
            <li>This page, containing the responsibilities and the UML diagrams for the two designs</li>
            <li>The question you are working on (next few pages)</li>
            <li>
                The workspace on the "Testing and Implementation" question

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On this workspace, you'll find we already implemented these designs and one of the factors!
                        Make sure to reference the code and specifications to better understand these designs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
