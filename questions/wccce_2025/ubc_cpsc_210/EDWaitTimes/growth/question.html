        Did you have fun, want to take this project further, or get more practice with CPSC 210 material? In software development,
        a project is rarely ever 'done' - there's almost always more to improve or add, and this project is no exception. See
        below for some extra <b>ungraded</b> activities for this question:

            After a closer look at the wait time records, we found that we want to exclude some data from our analysis. After March 20th,
            a bug was introduced to our data scraper, causing the wait times to be malformed. Specifically, we only want to look at
            any wait times before March 20th, 2024. Can you update the project to exclude this data and report whether any of the trends
            you found before changed? (This is just a hypothetical. We didn't really introduce a bug on that day! ðŸ˜„)

            We presented the results, but our grant funders are only interested in UBC Hospital's data (shocking)! Can we only
            look at wait times recorded at UBC (where the hospital's name is "UBCH") and report whether any of the trends you found changed?

            We just made two changes to filter data, and it looks like we may get more requests for filtering. Can you come up with a good design to improve the
            cohesion of the calculator class and extract filtering? Try implementing the new design with a type hierarchy and
            support both the date-based and UBC hospital filters above.

            A statistician gave us feedback that our bar chart is oversimplified, reducing the wait times to averages without
            showing their distribution. Can you update our project to use a BoxPlot instead and report any new findings?

        If you implement any of these extras (or anything else!), please share your results with us on the discussion forum!
        We'd love to see what you come up with. If possible, create a short video/screencast. This will help us a lot in making
        this question better in the future!
