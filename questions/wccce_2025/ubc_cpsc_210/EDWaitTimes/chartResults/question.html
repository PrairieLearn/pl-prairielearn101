        Now, before we begin on the next stage, let's walk through how we can run the tool we have built so far.
        First, go to the <code>src/main/ui</code> directory and open the <code>Main</code> class.
        Run the main method from there, and you should see a new folder be created called <code>charts</code>.
        Open the folder and open the image file. You should now be able to see the chart produced for average
        wait times by day of week - cool, right?

        This tool can be really helpful! On the <a href="https://edwaittimes.ca/">edwaittimes.ca</a> website, they say: "Most Emergency Departments are about 10% busier on Mondays.
        This may be due to the inability for people to get in touch with their physicians over the weekend." Let's compare with
        the results our tool has produced.
