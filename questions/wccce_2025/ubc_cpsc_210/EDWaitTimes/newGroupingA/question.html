        Let's say we wanted to support a new factor to this project, for example supporting grouping by hour of day.
        Which steps would we <i>have to</i> complete in Design A, and in what order?

                A point to think about: Design A uses an enum to represent the grouping type, and this enum is used
                in WaitTimesCalculatorA. Will the code that uses this enum stop compiling if a new enum value is added?

    <h5 class="card-title">A note on switch statements and code coverage</h5>
    <markdown>
In CPSC 110, you were taught to exhaustively cover all values of an enumeration when writing a `cond`. So why is it that in design A, we use the `default:` case
in a switch statement to handle `HOUR_OF_DAY` instead of `case HOUR_OF_DAY:`?

Although this is generally considered to be **bad design** (imagine if added another `WaitTimesGrouping` in the future),
it is necessary in the specific context of the Jacoco code coverage tool's behaviour and of our lab to make it possible to achieve 100% code coverage.

If we were to explicitly handle both `DAY_OF_WEEK` and `HOUR_OF_DAY` in the `switch`, the Java compiler would require us to add a `default` case,
which would be unreachable (and thus untestable).

In larger projects, full code coverage is often not realistic. A threshold is chosen, and new code must meet that threshold.
However, because of how code coverage impacts your autograder score, any untestable code would make it impossible for you to get 100%,
which wouldn't be ideal!
