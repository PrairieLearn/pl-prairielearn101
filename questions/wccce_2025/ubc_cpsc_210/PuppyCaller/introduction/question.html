  <h2>Lab 5: PuppyCaller</h2>
  <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Given a specification of a moderately complex abstraction,</li>
    <ul>
      <li>test the abstraction using jUnit</li>
      <li>implement the specification</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Use appropriate control flow operators (if, for, while, return) in Java</li>
    <li>Decompose a complex specification into its key test cases</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>To begin, access the lab's source code by opening the workspace in the "Testing and Implementation" question, which you can find by clicking 'Next Question' on the right.</strong></p>

  <h4>Overview</h4>

  <p>
    In this lab, we are working on a fun typing game "PuppyCaller" that is already in progress. In the game,
    a farmer is at work with the help of their puppies. Suddenly a loud truck startles the puppies, and they start running away.
    The farmer must call each puppy by name before they hop the fence! Players play as the farmer,
    and type puppies' names to call them. Specifically, the game follows this sequence:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The player starts calling a puppy by typing the first letter of its name. This 'selects' the puppy.</li>
    <li>The player must type the rest of its name to call it. Any incorrect input (e.g. typing 'a' when the next letter is 'c' is ignored)</li>
    <li>Once the player has typed the last character, the puppy is now 'called' and will stop running away. This also unselects the puppy, returning back to step 1.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The game already has a completed console-based user interface and some other functionality, but it is missing a key
    element: the input handler! In a game, an input handler receives the key(s) the
    player presses and takes the appropriate action. This is where you come in! You finish the design of the input handler class <code>PuppyCaller</code> based on its
    specification. Specifically, this includes methods to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Get and set the current selected puppy (useful for tests!)</li>
    <li>Type the name for the current puppy - corresponding to step 2 and 3 above.</li>
    <li>Find a puppy whose next character starts with an input character <code>c</code> - helpful for step 1.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These pieces come together in the <code>handleInput</code> method, which receives the input from the player's
    keyboard, and uses the other methods to implement the logic of the game. Take time to
    understand the specs of the <code>PuppyCaller</code> and the <code>Puppy</code> class before starting! In the <code>model</code> package,
    you <b>only</b> need to understand these two classes to complete the lab.
  </p>

  <p>Note that, as usual, you will have to wait 15 minutes between each request for feedback from the auto-grader and that you will not receive a grade if your code fails the checkstyle test.</p>
