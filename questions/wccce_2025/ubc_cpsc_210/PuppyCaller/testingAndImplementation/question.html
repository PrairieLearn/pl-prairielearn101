    <p>The code for this lab is available in the following workspace.</p>
    <pl-workspace></pl-workspace>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>You must not attempt to make any changes to the workspace settings or to install any workspace extensions.</b></p>
    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>
        Use the <code>PuppyCallerTest</code> class to design unit tests for the methods in the <code>PuppyCaller</code> class
        The methods are already roughly ordered from easiest to test to hardest to test. <code>handleInput</code>
        relies on helpers; so, it is the most complicated to test! Some tips:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Consider setting up one or more lists of puppies for tests in your <code>BeforeEach</code> method.</li>
        <li>Some methods have many cases to consider based on: the state of the selected puppy (whether one is selected and how much typing progress has been made),
            the length and content of puppy names, and how many puppies there are to choose from!</li>
        <li>As always, work systematically, draft cases on pen and paper, and ask for help if you're stuck!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When you are done, run the tests in the <code>PuppyCallerTest</code> class. Some tests
        may pass because stubs happen to produce the right value, but many should fail because the game is not yet functional!
    </p>

    <h4>Manual Testing / Playing the Game</h4>

    <p>
        Manual testing or "playtesting" is essential in video game development!
	Playtesting means having a human play the game. Playtesting may focus on players' experience, behaviours that emerge, frustrations, 
        or even trying to break the game by systematically putting it into "edge cases". This process may reveal new test cases and design insights
	that update the whole design.
        In CPSC 210, we often go through the software development process (design, testing, development) and afterwards do only brief manually testing.
	During this lab, it can be helpful (and fun!)
        to playtest your work alongside your unit tests as your implementation progresses to see your work in action.
    </p>

    <p>
        Play the game by pressing the 'play' button (▶️) on the top right of the workspace editor, across from the file names at the top.
        If you do not immediately see it when you open the workspace, wait around 45 seconds for the editor to load the project and try opening
        the <code>Main</code> class in the <code>ui</code> package. If you encounter issues playing the game, verify:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your code compiles - otherwise, the build will close with no error message</li>
        <li>You selected the window in the editor to type into it, otherwise your input won't be registered</li>
        <li>You gave enough space to the window/editor to display the game, otherwise the puppies will overlap each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Implementation</h4>

    <p>
        Right now you can play the game, but as the puppies run across the screen, typing their names
        does nothing. Let's fix that! Complete the implementation of the <code>PuppyCaller</code> class.
        As you implement methods, more and more of your tests will pass. Try playtesting
        to see how your code is making the game increasingly playable!
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> the rest of the game accesses the <code>PuppyCaller</code> class through the <code>handleInput</code> method.
        If that method is not implemented, the game remains nonfunctional. So, consider
        implementing it early! As you do, think about where and how the other methods might be helpful.
    </p>

    <p>Once you have implemented the whole <code>PuppyCaller</code> class, you should see:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>All your tests passing - if a test fails, the bug could be in the test or your implementation</li>
        <li>Your jacoco report has full code coverage for the <code>PuppyCaller</code> class</li>
        <li>The game is functional - emphasis on the fun!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This part can feel difficult, and that's ok! You're solving a challenging problem.
        Take your time through each method and experiment; use the game as your reference! As always, reach out to the teaching staff for help when you are stuck
        - we're here to help your learning!
    </p>

    <h4>Submit to AutoGrader</h4>
    <p>Ensure that your code passes the checkstyle test before submitting to the auto-grader. When you are satisfied that you have a complete solution to the problem, click
      the "Save & Grade" button below.</p>

    <p>Your grade will comprise a score from running our reference tests (weighted 50%), a score based on the number of bugs identified when your tests are run against incorrect implementations
      (weighted 40%) and a score from code coverage (weighted 10%). The code coverage score will be determined from measures of line coverage and branch coverage.</p>

    <p>The grader will provide hints for up to three failing reference tests. These hints may not be that helpful if you haven't already thoroughly explored your own test suite!</p>

                We are using <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing" target="_blank">mutation testing</a></em> as in CPSC 110 in this lab.
                This means that we run your tests against several flawed implementation of this lab's specification, called mutants.
                A mutant run against a thorough and correct test suite should cause at least one test to fail.
                <br>
                Since we're still new to mutation testing in CPSC 210, here are some tips on what each mutant does wrong.
                Future labs will likely expect you to build a thorough test suite yourself without these types of hints.

- **callPuppyNoReset:** `typeNameForCurrentPuppy` does not update `currentPuppy` after a puppy is called
{{#COMMENT}}
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/Lab4-PuppyCaller/blob/530e95869fb0d7050d00c0f7cd439f33807343f8/src/main/java/model/PuppyCaller.java#L71

This mutant violates the specification of `typeNameForCurrentPuppy`:
"If the puppy has been called after typing that character, current puppy will be null"
In the mutated code, `currentPuppy` isn't set to null.
To catch this bug, students must use `assertEquals` or `assertNull` on the value of `getCurrentPuppy()`
after calling `typeNameForCurrentPuppy`.

The current hint might be too direct. An alternative that's more vague is:
- **callPuppyNoReset:** `currentPuppy` is not reset after a puppy is called

By omitting the name of the buggy function, students will have to find it themselves.
{{/COMMENT}}
- **constructorCreatesDefault:** constructor initializes `currentPuppy` to an incorrect value
{{#COMMENT}}
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/Lab4-PuppyCaller/blob/ed8fd8a5803669ab5379da62ea04bf62f9db03ac/src/main/java/model/PuppyCaller.java#L34

This mutant violates the specification of `PuppyCaller`'s constructor:
"creates an instance of this class with no current puppy selected."

Instead, the buggy test sets `currentPuppy` to a bogus value.
A simple test for the constructor will catch this bug.

I've intentionally left the hint ambiguous as to *which* constructor is incorrect.
Still, I don't think anyone will struggle with this mutant.

- **findPuppyMultipleFail:** `findPuppy` produces incorrect output when multiple puppies match the input
{{#COMMENT}}
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/Lab4-PuppyCaller/blob/690ad5a8e40a4865f047824147a9c88738952835/src/main/java/model/PuppyCaller.java#L92

This is a convoluted mutant that exists to make sure students test `findPuppy` in the case where
multiple puppies match the typed letter.
It violates the specification of `findPuppy`:
"returns any puppy in the list whose next character is c"

Students can eliminate this mutant by testing the case where multiple puppies start with the same
letter.
{{/COMMENT}}
- **findPuppyOnlyChecksFirst:** another mutant where `findPuppy` produces incorrect output when there are multiple puppies
{{#COMMENT}}
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/Lab4-PuppyCaller/blob/01d478bbede43f426a57cae5a04ecd2c84be37aa/src/main/java/model/PuppyCaller.java#L83

Similarly to the previous bug, this mutant ensures students test `findPuppy` in cases where there
is more than one puppy.
It also violates the specification of `findPuppy`:
"returns any puppy in the list whose next character is c"
since it will only check the first.

Students can eliminate this mutant by testing the case where a puppy other than the first matches the
input letter.
{{/COMMENT}}
- **handleInputCurrentPuppyNotUpdated:** `handleInput` does not update `currentPuppy` after a puppy is first selected
{{#COMMENT}}
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/Lab4-PuppyCaller/blob/27db633cdcd6458d703f87ea4eb240c02aa5e009/src/main/java/model/PuppyCaller.java#L136

When no puppy is selected, `handleInput` searches for the next puppy to select and stores it in `currentPuppy`.
In this bug, the next puppy isn't saved, so `currentPuppy` remains `null`.
This violates the precondition of `typeNameForCurrentPuppy`, causing a `NullPointerException`.
Because of the unchecked exception, any student who tests `handleInput` will catch this bug.

The hint is probably redundant, since this bug is so easy to catch.
Still, I've included it for consistency.
{{/COMMENT}}
- **handleInputNoCallOnFirstMatch:** `handleInput` does not "type" a letter when a puppy is first selected
{{#COMMENT}}
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC210/Lab4-PuppyCaller/blob/ce9f9fdb069a2edd4d0ba099c4ba4c5a8f49d132/src/main/java/model/PuppyCaller.java#L136

The previous mutant didn't set `currentPuppy`, and called `typeNameForCurrentPuppy`.
This mutant sets `currentPuppy` when a puppy is initially selected, but doesn't call `typeNameForCurrentPuppy`.

Students can catch this bug by making assertions about the state of the puppy that should have
been typed, e.g. whether or not it's been called, or what its next letter is.

I think in this case an explicit hint is fine—this is one of the trickier mutants to catch.
