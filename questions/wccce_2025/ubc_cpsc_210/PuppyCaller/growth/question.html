        Did you have fun, want to take this project further, or get more practice with CPSC 210 material? In software development,
        a project is rarely ever 'done' - there's almost always more to improve or add, and this game is no exception. See
        below for some extra <b>ungraded</b> activities for the lab:

            After some playtesting, we found that players often felt confused or frustrated by the case sensitivity in the game.
            Can you update the game to accept a player's input as correct, even if they enter the wrong case of the expected character?
            (e.g. typing 'A' instead of 'a' or the other way around)

            Some players seem to think the game is too easy, and want to make the puppy's progress reset if you type the incorrect character.
            Can you update the game to require the player to type the name correctly without mistakes to call it?

            <ul>

            Players seem to be frustrated by the current behaviour when there are multiple puppies that start with the
            same character - there does not seem to be a reliable way of knowing which puppy you'll end up selecting!
            Can you update the game to, when there are multiple puppies with the same character, select the
            puppy that is closest to the fence?

            <ul>
                <li><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</li>
                <li><b>Time:</b> ~15-45min</li>

            Marketing seems to think the names we chose for the puppies are too dull and would like to see a variety of
            name lengths in each round. Can you figure out how puppy names are selected,
            change the names that are selected as well as diversify the name lengths?

            <ul>
                <li><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</li>
                <li><b>Time:</b> ~30-45min</li>

            We updated the game to select the puppy closest to the fence when there are ties, but players still seem to
            be getting confused. Our game designer thinks that players should type freely, and only once they exactly match
            a puppy's name will it be called and the 'typing box' be reset. For example, if there are puppies Alpha, Alcho,
            and Alfred, I start by typing 'A' and all three puppies are selected. If I continue with 'l', all match and remain selected.
            Only once I type the third differentiating character will the individual puppy be selected. This will require significant work
            outside the PuppyCaller class too. Can you make these changes?

            <ul>
                <li><b>Difficulty:</b> Hard</li>
                <li><b>Time:</b> 45min or more</li>

        If you implement any of these extras (or anything else!), please share your results with us on the discussion forum!
        We'd love to see what you come up with. If possible, create a short video/screencast. This will help us a lot making
        this lab better in the future!
