You are hired by a bike sharing company that wants to use machine learning to better manage their bicycle inventory across the five stations in their network.

They give you a spreadsheet of bicycle demand per hour for the last year, with {{params.rows}} rows and the following columns:

- month (1 to 12)
- hour (0 to 23)
- weekend (0 for M, T, W, Th and 1 for Sat, Sun)
- holiday (0 for non-holiday days, 1 for holidays)
- temperature (in Â°C)
- precipitation (in cm)
- station index (0 to 4)
- number of bikes checked out in that hour

You decide to use a fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer.

Your network will output a vector, with the predicted bike demand for each station. For example, if the output of the network is [0, 3, 2, 1, 1], this means that the expected demand is 0 bikes for station 0, 3 bikes for station 1, 2 bikes for station 2, 1 bike for station 3, and 1 bike for station 4.

(Note: the station index column will not be a "feature" input to your model, since each output from the network includes a value for each station!)

<pl-answer-panel><br><hr><p><span class="badge badge-primary">Comment</span> This is a regression problem with vector output. The network should have 5 output units - one for each station - because it will predict a value for each station.</p></pl-answer-panel>

<pl-answer-panel><br><hr><p><span class="badge badge-primary">Comment</span> You can select the number of hidden units; it's not dictated by the problem. 
Your choice will determine how much capacity the network has for learning a complicated function.</p></pl-answer-panel>

<p>What activation function will you use at the hidden units?</p>

<pl-answer-panel><br><hr><p><span class="badge badge-primary">Comment</span> Acceptable options include relu, sigmoid, or tanh. </p>
<p>The linear activation function is not a good choice for the hidden units, since then the network will not learn any non-linear function, and will be equivalent to a classical linear regression. </p>
<p>The sofmax activation is used at the output units when we want to produce a probability distribution over a set of discrete classes, but that doesn't apply here.</p></pl-answer-panel>
