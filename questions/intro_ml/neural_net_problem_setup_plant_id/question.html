You have been hired by an exciting new startup that is developing a plant identification app. The goal is for users to be able to take a photo of any flower, tree, or other plant, and the app will tell them its name.

You decide to train a fully connected neural network on a small training set, to see how well it works. You go to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and take photos of flowers as follows:

1. 109 photos of New England aster
2. 773 photos of cardinal flower
3. 982 photos of dahlia
4. 914 photos of Japanese anemone
5. 476 photos of black-eyed Susan
6. 228 photos of rose-of-Sharon
7. 844 photos of spotted bee balm
8. 910 photos of petunia
9. 248 photos of great blue lobelia
10. 843 photos of gray goldenrod
11. 401 photos of spider flower
12. 950 photos of purple coneflower
13. 341 photos of autumn crocus

Each photo is {{params.dims.0}} pixels wide by {{params.dims.1}} pixels high and in full color (3 color channels).

You set aside 20% of the photos of each plant for a test set, and use the rest as a training set for your network.

<pl-answer-panel><br><hr><p><span class="badge badge-primary">Comment</span> You can select the number of hidden units; it's not dictated by the problem. 
Your choice will determine how much capacity the network has for learning a complicated function.</p></pl-answer-panel>

<p>What activation function will you use at the hidden units?</p>

<pl-answer-panel><br><hr><p><span class="badge badge-primary">Comment</span> Acceptable options include relu, sigmoid, or tanh. </p>
<p>The linear activation function is not a good choice for the hidden units, since then the network will not learn any non-linear function, and will be equivalent to a classical linear regression. </p>
<p>The sofmax activation is used at the output units when we want to produce a probability distribution over a set of discrete classes, but not at the hidden units.</p></pl-answer-panel>
