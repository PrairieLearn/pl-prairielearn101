You are developing a machine learning model to automatically grade an open-ended short answer question on an Intro ML final exam. Your model will be trained using a dataset of {{params.n}} past student answers to this question.

To represent the text samples in your training data as fixed-length numeric vectors, you are using a "bag of words" model, where the text samples are processed as follows:

1.  Remove the "trivial" words that you want to ignore, such as "the", "an", "has", etc. from the text.
2.  Compile a "vocabulary" - a list of all of the words in the dataset - with integer indices from 0 to $d-1$.
3. Convert every sample into a $d$-dimensional vector $x$, by letting the $j$th coordinate of $x$ be the number of occurences of the $j$th words in the document. (This number is often called the "term frequency".)

After you have completed this process, you have a numeric array that is {{params.n}} rows and {{params.d}} columns.

Next, you encode the target variable. Each sample in the dataset has previously been manually graded according to a rubric, where the rubric options are:

* Correct answer (full credit)
* Answer is incorrect because of reason X (half credit)
* Answer is incorrect because of reason Y (half credit)
* Answer is incorrect because of reason Z (zero credit)
* Answer is incorrect for another reason (zero credit)

You use one-hot encoding to encode the target variable, so that each rubric option is represented as a column, and each sample has a "1" in exactly one of them (and "0" in the rest).

You set aside 20% of the data for a test set, and use the rest as a training set for your model. Now, you are going to train a fully connected neural network on this data.

<pl-answer-panel><br><hr><p><span class="badge badge-primary">Comment</span> Acceptable options include relu, sigmoid, or tanh. </p>
<p>The linear activation function is not a good choice for the hidden units, since then the network will not learn any non-linear function, and will be equivalent to a classical linear regression. </p>
<p>The sofmax activation is used at the output units when we want to produce a probability distribution over a set of discrete classes, but not at the hidden units.</p></pl-answer-panel>
