  <p>For some types of models, we need to standardize data (center and scale to unit variance) before model fitting. Given some data <code>X</code>, training data indices <code>idx_tr</code>, and test data indices <code>idx_ts</code>, which of the following illustrates a correct way to standardize the data? Select all that apply.</p>
