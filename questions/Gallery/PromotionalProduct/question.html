    In this question you will complete the implementation of a class
    used in a system to handle customer sales for a store. Assume the
    following class declaration for a class
    named <code>Product</code>:
  </p>

  <pl-code language="java" source-file-name="code/Product.java"></pl-code>

  <p>
    Now implement a new class named <code>PromotionalProduct</code>
    that is similar to <code>Product</code>, but that has a special
    price for higher quantities. If the order quantity is larger than
    or equal to <code>promotionQuantity</code>, then the price per
    unit is <code>promotionPrice</code>, otherwise the regular price
    applies (for example, the product is priced at 50 dollars, but if
    you buy at least 10 items you only pay 45 dollars). Note that most
    of the functionality is already implemented, you only need to
    implement the <code>getTotalPrice</code> method.
