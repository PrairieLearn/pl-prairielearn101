    In this question you will continue the implementation of a system
    to handle customer sales for a store. Assume the following class
    declaration for a class named <code>Product</code>:
  </p>

  <pl-code language="java" source-file-name="code/Product.java"></pl-code>

  <p class="mt-2">
    The class <code>Invoice</code> below uses the product classes
    above to create an invoice with a list of products and respective
    quantities. Implement the <code>getTotal</code> method so that it
    returns the sum of the total price of all products in the
    invoice. Your implementation must be able to handle products with
    different behaviours for total computation, such as
    the <code>PromotionalProduct</code> class developed in the
    previous question.
