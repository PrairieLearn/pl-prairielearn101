    <p>Jimmy is at Hollister and he wants to buy a hoodie. 
        The hoodie costs $65, but it has a discount of 15%.</p> 
    <p>Write a program to help Jimmy calculate the sale price of the hoodie. 
        The program must ask Jimmy for the item price, and then it will display 
        the sale price with a precision of 2 decimal places.</p>
    <p>You <b>must</b> declare a double constant variable and assign it with the sale percentage.</p>
    <p>You <b>must</b> declare the sale percentage using scientific notation.
        (No, this isn't how you would normally write a program like this, but it is a convenient demo.)
    </p>
    <p>Below is an example of the program:</p>

    <pl-code language="output">
Enter an item price: $65.00
The sale price is $55.25
