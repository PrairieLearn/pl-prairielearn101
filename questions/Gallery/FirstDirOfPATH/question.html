    The <code>PATH</code> environment variable contains a list of
    directories, separated by a colon ("<code>:</code>"), where
    executables can be found. Suppose you want to find a list of all
    unique top-level directories that are represented in the list
    pointed to by path, as well as the number of times the directory
    is used, sorted by name. For example, if the <code>PATH</code> is:
  </p>
  <pl-code>/cs/home/jonatanstu/bin:/usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/xsys/bin:/usr/local/sbin</pl-code>
  <p>You want to find the list:</p>
  <pl-code>      1 bin
      1 cs
      1 sbin
      4 usr
      1 xsys</pl-code>
  <p>Provide a command that uses multiple commands in a pipe to
    perform the translation above. Here is a suggested approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <code>echo</code> to print the value of the variable <code>$PATH</code>.</li>
    <li>Convert the colons into newlines. There are multiple ways to
      do this, but the <code>tr</code> command is probably one of the
      simplest options.</li>
    <li>Extract only the first directory name from the
      paths. The <code>cut</code> command is a good option here,
      though <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code> can also be
      used.</li>
    <li>Sort the entries in alphabetical order, using a command
      like <code>sort</code>.</li>
    <li>Remove the duplicate entries and count
      them. The <code>uniq</code> command can be useful to provide
      this functionality.</li>
  </ul>
