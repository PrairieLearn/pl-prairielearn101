## Task 1: GitHub Tutorial - Main

Git and GitHub is a difficult thing to teach so after many years of searching, I have found the [**PERFECT**
tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org).
This tutorial, in addition to the videos for this week, will help you get more familiar with git commands, particularly
branching, and merging - things you will start encountering when you start collaboratively working in your repos.

It is important to realize that in this course, you will not explicitly be tested on any git commands except `add`, `commit`, `fetch`, `switch`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`, `branch`.
You may be tempted to only do those activities, but the more you play around and experiment with Git, the more comfortable you will be with it.

I recommend that at minimum, you complete the following modules, but you're more than welcome (and encouraged!) to do
more, especially if you're having fun and still learning.

"Main: Introduction Sequence"
- Exercise 1
- Exercise 2
- Exercise 3
- Exercise 4

"Ramping up"
- Exercise 1
- Exercise 2
- Exercise 3
- Exercise 4

Once you have completed these tasks, take a screenshot of the main tab as shown below, and move on to Task 2!

## Upload instructions

- Once you are finished with this part, take a screenshot of the page, and upload it here.
- Once the picture is on your computer, convert it to a PNG file (this is an image file format). [Here are some instructions to convert an image into a PNG.](https://www.howtogeek.com/363444/how-to-convert-an-image-to-png-format/).
- Rename the picture to **exactly** `task1.png`.
<!-- - Here are some instructions on how to rename a file on:
    - [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/665514/6-ways-to-rename-files-and-folders-in-windows-10/)
    - [macOS](https://www.howtogeek.com/270747/the-fastest-ways-to-rename-files-on-macos/).
-->
- Note that the file size limit for this question is 5MB (unfortunately this is not something I can change). You may need to reduce the resolution of your file, especially if you're importing from an iPhone.
