There's a pile of old **rags**.  They are old and worn with
age, and probably fell off of some poor adventurer.

read RESP

if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ];then
    cat << EOF
As you take the rags from the floor, you find a salted fish,
probably from the rations of the former owner of these rags.
Prefix these items to your inventory:

export I=rags,fish,\$I

Remember, you can check your inventory"

echo \$I
