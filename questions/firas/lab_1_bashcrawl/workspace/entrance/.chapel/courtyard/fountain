You try to resist, but you cannot.  You dip your hand into
the fountain,  and you feel your skin burning.  The pain
snaps you out of your trance and you only suffer -2 HP.

Remember to deduct 2 points from your HP variable:

let "HP=HP-2"

}

CURSE=`find .. -type f -name ".curse"`

printf "Do you want to approach the fountain? "
read RESP

if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ]; then
    cat << EOF
The waters sparkle in the light of your gaze.  You feel
drawn to it.

EOF
    if [ x$CURSE = "x" ]; then
        cat << EOF
But you suddenly feel strength to turn away.  You hear a
sigh from the altar in the chapel.
