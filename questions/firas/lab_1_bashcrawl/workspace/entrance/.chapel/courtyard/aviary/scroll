You enter a room that has been magically frost-bitten.

Snow and frost covers the ground, an icy pond leading perhaps
to an underground lake or to the outside, is in the far corner.

A few small black and white birds waddle around the room,
taking no notice of you.

Tip:
You can make your shell autocomplete the names of files and
directories by pressing the Tab key after typing the first
few letters.

When you move to the next room, try typing

cd h

and then press TAB.
