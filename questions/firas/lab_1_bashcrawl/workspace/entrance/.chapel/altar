In the corner is a decaying old altar of some forgotten god.

There is a small trinket on the ground.  It looks religious
in nature.

printf "Do you want to put the trinket back on the altar? "
read RESP

if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ]; then
    cat << EOF
You place the trinket upon the altar.  You feel a gentle
breeze pass through the room.

        touch .curse
    else
        cat << EOF
You leave the trinket where it lies.  There is a great
sadness here.  You feel compelled to move on.

# If you're not seeing the * after
