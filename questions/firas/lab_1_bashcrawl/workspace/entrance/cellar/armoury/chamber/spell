You recall the lessons of Caitlyn the Green, who taught you
these ancient letters.  

The runes are instructions on how to summon a portal that
will allow you to walk through an invisible door contained
in the wall.

In Bash, a symbolic link (symlink) is a *shortcut* to
another file or directory.  Create one from this room to the
adjacent one:

ln -fs ../../../chapel/courtyard/aviary/hall portal

    cat << EOF
