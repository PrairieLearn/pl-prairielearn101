# Illusions are strong here.
# It is difficult to tell what is a doorway and what is an object.
#
# The magic spell you use to look can be augmented.
#
# From now on, cast your spell like this:
# 
# ls -F
# 
# Directories (the rooms of these catacombs) end with a / symbol.
# 
# Encounters (programs) end with a * symbol.
#
# You can avoid having to type `ls -F` every time by running the
# following:
#
# alias ls='ls -F'
#
# This is known as a shell or command alias.  With this alias,
# typing simply ls by itself will run ls -F. Try it out!
