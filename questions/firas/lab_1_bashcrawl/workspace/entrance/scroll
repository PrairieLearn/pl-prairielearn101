It is pitch black in these catacombs.
You have a magical spell that lists all items in a room.

To see in the dark, type:     ls
To move around, type:         cd <directory>

Try looking around this room.
Then move into one of the next rooms.

EXAMPLE:

$ ls 
$ cd cellar

Remember to cast ``ls`` when you get into the next room!
