# There is a fine gold goblet at the center of a
# runic triangle on the floor.
# You try to take the goblet, but your hand
# passes through it as if it were illusory.
#
# You notice a glowing orb, labeled orb1, in one
# corner of the triangle. The other points of the 
# triangle are labeled orb2 and orb3, but the orbs 
# have long since been stolen by tomb raiders.
#
# Perhaps adding more orbs would free the goblet's 
# material form.
# 
# You remember a spell your magick teacher,
# Caitlin the Green, taught you long ago:
# a spell to copy and name objects...
