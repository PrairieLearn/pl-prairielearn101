You see the corpse of a slain adventurer on the floor of the
dungeon.  You find the following items on the corpse:

You dodge an attack, but you miss your mark as a result.
Roll again...

A hit! A palpable hit!  You have slain the spirit of the
evil wizard.

Your sword swings harmlessly through the air.  You take 5
points damage. Deduct this from your HP variable:  

let HP=HP-5

EOF
        let HP=HP-5
        if [ "$HP" -le 0 ]; then
            cat << EOF
You suddenly feel cold, the life force draining from your
body.  You have been slain by the ghost of an evil wizard.

GAME OVER!

}

cat << EOF
The room shakes, a gust of wind blasts you from nowhere.
You sense that a presence has entered the room.  The pain
you suddenly feel assures you that you are under attack by a
ghostly entity!

If you have a sword, you can attack.  Otherwise, you should
run.  

EOF
printf "Do you want to attack? y/n  "
read RESP

if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ];then
    roll
    resolve
else
    cat << EOF
You wisely turn and flee.  Quickly cd to the previous
directory.
