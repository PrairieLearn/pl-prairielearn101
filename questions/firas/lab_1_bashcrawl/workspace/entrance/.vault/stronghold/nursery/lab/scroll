# An abandoned laboratory of a wizard long dead.
# 
# A lone magickal torch ignites as you enter, shedding
# light on the workshop, and casts haunting shadows
# on every surface.
#
# The flames lick the walls, burning off the moss that had
# gathered there. The burning moss sizzles in the silence
# of the catacombs, like angelic wailing or singing.
