This is the notebook of Thraal, Artificer of the Kingdom of
Nor.  I have been studying the machines that lie in this
Satellite.  I have a way to combine the parts to form a
golem, a *robot*, using the same incantation that I use to
view signs and scrolls in my home world.  I have discovered
that in order to bring the robot to life I must utter the
following spell:

    chmod +x robot

I have labeled the four parts alpha, beta, gamma, delta,
but that is not the order I must combine them.  I must
pass the combined parts into another spell which I will
document below.  The first incantation I tried was thus:

    cat alpha beta gamma delta | base64 -d > robot

...but that was met with the following error:  

    base64:  invalid input

I have noticed that not every order thus will produce
the same error, but the resulting robot still does not
work.  I discovered another incantation that will tell
me the robot is assembled correctly:

    sha256sum -c sha256sums

I will attempt every combination and document the one
that succeeds. 

    alpha beta delta gamma 
    alpha delta bet

There appears to be dried blood on the notebook, and the
rest of the pages are blank.
