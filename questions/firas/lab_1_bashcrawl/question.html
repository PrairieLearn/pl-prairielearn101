<markdown>This activity is a really fun way to learn how to use some of the Terminal commands you will need to know.
Have fun with it, and try not to take it too seriously - you don't need to beat the whole game, just keep playing till you stop learning or stop having fun!

Much of the information in the game is beyond the scope of this course, so take what you can get out of it and use your judgement.
In this course, you will only be assessed on the basic Terminal comands (discussed in lecture 1B including the options).

## Objectives

- Practice with Terminal interfaces
- Create and navigate directories
- Create, modify, rename and delete files

## Instructions

Here is a text guide of the first few steps of the game:

### Setting up for the game

1. Open a Terminal window in the Workspace.
2. Change the directory to where this file is: `cd /path/to/this/folder`.
3. Type `ls` into the Terminal; you will see two things: `README.md` and the `entrance` directory.
4. Once you go into the `entrance` directory (`cd entrance`), the Terminal-based game will begin!

**Tip: When I say "go into the <BLANK>" room, I mean change directories using `cd <BLANK>`. In this game, a "room" is a "directory".**

### Starting the game

5. Now that you have entered the dungeon `entrance`, you should type `ls` in the terminal to look around and see
what's there.

6. You will see there are two "things" in this room, there is a `scroll`, and another room called `cellar`.

7. Let's read the scroll using `cat scroll`.

**Tip: When I say "read the scroll", I mean output the contents of the scroll file into the Terminal using `cat
scroll`.**

8. Great! The scroll told us that we can look and see what's in the room using `ls` and move in and out of rooms
using `cd <directory>`. Let's go into the cellar: `cd cellar`.

9. Once we're in the `cellar`, let's have a look around: `ls`. You should see an `armoury`, a `scroll`, and
some `treasure`.

10. Let's read the scroll: `cat scroll`. It should tell you about `ls -F`. Here is some more information
about `ls -F`:

> Display a slash (`/`) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk ('*') after each
that is executable, an AT sign ('@') after each symbolic link.

11. That sounds useful, let's do an `ls -F` in the cellar to see what each of the things are. You'll notice
that the armoury is another room, the scroll is just a file, and the treasure has a "*" at the end, so it's
an executable. Cool! We don't know what to do with the executable yet, but let's try `cat treasure` to see
what happens.

12. Mm. Didn't work - okay let's move on and come back to this room later. Let's go into the `armoury` now:
`cd armoury` and then `ls -F`.

13. We see another scroll (and a potion, a treasure, and another room)! Let's read the scroll: `cat scroll`.

14. Oooh, we have now learned how to collect `treasure`! Let's do that in the armoury and follow the
instructions to keep our treasure (using environment variables).

**Tip: When I say "pick up the `<BLANK>`", I mean run the executable file using `./ <BLANK>`.**

15. It tells us to go back and get the treasure from the cellar! Let's go and do that now with `cd
..`, pick up the treasure from the cellar, and then come back to the armoury.

16. The potion is also something we can "pick up", so let's go ahead and do that. It asks us if you
want to drink it: type 'Y' for yes, and anything else for no (like 'n'). Choose an option and see
what happens (follow on-screen instructions!)

17. Alright check if there's anything else to do this in room, if not, head to the `chamber` next.
Start with `ls -F` and hopefully by now, you know the drill!

18. Have fun! More dungeon rooms will open up as you complete certain tasks, kill certain monsters,
and read specific scrolls and tomes. Have fun with it, this is your opportunity to practice your
Terminal skills - it sure beats the way I learned Terminal commands (blindly typing in commands in a
black box until I got it to do what I wanted!). There is no need to hit **every** room in the
dungeon, but do make a concerted effort and you'll likely get most of the marks for this lab.

**Tip: You can ignore a few of the more "advanced" entries of the Tome, including anything related
to `tmux` or `gzip`. I say "pick up the <BLANK>", I mean run the executable file using `./ <BLANK>
        `.**

### What you need to submit for Bashcrawl.

When you're done exploring the dungeon there are several things I want you to do:

#### 1. Run `tree`, and then save the output to a file :

**VERY IMPORTANT: Please `cd` to your main lab directory before running any of the following commands! Please move any
created files in the main lab directory, NOT anywhere in the entrance folder.**

```
tree
tree > mydungeonmap.txt
```

#### 2. Save the last 250 commands from your Terminal

**VERY IMPORTANT: Please `cd` to your main lab directory before running any of the following commands! Please move any
created files in the main lab directory, NOT anywhere in the entrance folder.**

We want to see some serious effort with the dungeon map, so we are asking for the last 250 commands you entered into the
Terminal.
Please open this file and do a quick check to make sure there is no sensitive information in this file (like passwords
or private messages).
If there is, you can simply edit the file or remove that command.

**Note: Just because we're asking for the last 250 commands doesn't mean that we expect you to have 250 commands, you
may have less and you may have more. That's fine.**

```
history 250 > dungeonHistory.txt
```

#### 3. Show your TA

During your scheduled lab section next week, show your TA the `mydungeonmap` and `dungeonHistory` and they will:

- Give you the magic number for 50% credit on the lab
- Either ask you to explore the dungeon some more, or grant you full credit for the lab.

I have recorded a video to get you started with this lab: [Click here to view the video](https://vimeo.com/570825537).
**Note that we will only be doing a portion of that lab in this course (CPSC 203) so ignore everything related to JupyterLab and Git this week.**
