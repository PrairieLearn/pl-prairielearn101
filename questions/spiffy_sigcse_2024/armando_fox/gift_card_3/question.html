# Part 3 of 5: DRY out tests with common preconditions  

Now, we would like to DRY out our code by using the `before(:each)` block.
Arrange the common lines of the previous tests into the `before` block with the
unique lines in their own `it` blocks. The verification criteria from the 
previous question is repeated here for your convenience.  
  
Below is the implementation of `GiftCard`
```ruby
class GiftCard
  attr_reader :balance, :error
  def initialize(balance)
    if balance < 0
      raise ArgumentError.new("New gift card cannot have negative balance")
    end
    @balance = balance
    @error = ""
  end
  def withdraw(amount)
    if @balance >= amount
      @balance -= amount
    else
      @error = "Insufficient balance"
      return nil
    end
  end
end
```  
  
In this question, construct tests that verify:
* a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success
* a withdrawal when there is enough cash changes the card balance
* a withdrawal when there is enough cash does not produce an error message
