# Overview of CHIPS 8.5: Intro to RSpec

Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
balance.  
  
The system under test (SUT) consists of two classes that model the
GiftCard and the Customer.  Your task 
is to write a test suite for certain behaviors of these classes.  
In each part of this exercise, you'll add tests for new behaviors of
the gift card.  You must complete each part with 100% credit before
you can move on to the next part, but you have an unlimited number of
submission attempts to do so and there is no penalty for multiple
submissions. 

Some test cases will be very simple, whereas
others will make use of test doubles,
DRYing out of preconditions, and other techniques.
But keep in mind that in the end, every test
case follows the same pattern:

1. **Arrange** any preconditions that must be in place in order for this test case to exercise the desired specific behaviors in the SUT.

2. **Act** by stimulating the SUT to elicit the behavior

3. **Assert** that various postconditions are true after the SUT has been exercised.

In the first part, we'll show you the code to be tested, and you'll
start by writing some simple specs about the behavior of creating a
gift card.
