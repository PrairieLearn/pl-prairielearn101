The implementation of the `Customer#pay` method tries to call `GiftCard#withdraw`.
However, recall that a best practice for unit test writing is that
each test should be Indepedent of all others (that's what the "I"
stands for in the mnemonic "FIRST": Fast, Independent, Repeatable,
Self-checking, Timely).

Therefore, to isolate the behavior of `Customer#pay` from the
implementation of `GiftCard#withdraw`, we will use a test double to
"stand in" for the latter method.

Which part(s) of the tests for `Customer#pay` will need to be
concerned with this test double?
