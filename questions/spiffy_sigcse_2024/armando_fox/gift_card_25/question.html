    Even though you just wrote three happy path test cases that check three different behaviors,
    some of those test cases have elements in common that we can DRY out.
    In the next part, we will DRY out those elements by gathering them into a common
    <code>before(:each)</code> block.

  <p>
    Comparing the three test cases, which parts of the
    test pattern (arrange, act, assert) are common among the three?
