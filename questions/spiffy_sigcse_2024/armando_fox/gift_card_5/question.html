# Part 5 of 5: Sad path for Customer#pay and DRYing out tests with common preconditions

For our last step we will test the sad path of `Customer#pay` and factor out 
common lines of test code to keep things DRY. We will use the same double, 
but this time we will instruct it to always return a falsy value so we can test 
the other code path in `#pay`. Since setting up the double (and the 
`Customer` instance) are common to both test cases, we should move them into a 
`before` block as we did with `GiftCard`, and group the related examples and 
their `before` block in a `describe`.  
  
```ruby
class Customer
  attr_accessor :name, :gift_card
  def initialize(name, gift_card=nil)
    @gift_card = gift_card
    @name = name
  end
  def pay(amount)
    if gift_card.withdraw(amount)
      self.notify("payment successful")
    else
      self.notify("purchase cannot be completed")
    end
  end
end
```

In this question, construct tests that verify:
* a payment from a Customer has a giftcard with sufficient balance notifies the customer of the successful transaction
* a payment from a Customer has a giftcard with insufficient balance notifies the customer of the unsuccessful transaction
