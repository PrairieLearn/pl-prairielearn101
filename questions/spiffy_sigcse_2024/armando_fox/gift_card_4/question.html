# Part 4 of 5: Using a double to handle a call to a helper method
  
Take a look `Customer` below and in particular at the `pay` method, which is the
subject of the next set of tests that you will construct.

```ruby
class Customer
  attr_accessor :name, :gift_card
  def initialize(name, gift_card=nil)
    @gift_card = gift_card
    @name = name
  end
  def pay(amount)
    if gift_card.withdraw(amount)
      self.notify("payment successful")
    else
      self.notify("purchase cannot be completed")
    end
  end
end
```

The new challenge in testing `#pay` is that it calls an instance method of another
class (`GiftCard#withdraw`). In this case we know all about the behavior of that 
method, but if we don't know the details of how it works, or -- even worse -- if it's
temporarily broken, we don't want our tests to fail just because `#withdraw` is failing.
So we use test doubles to isolate the `Customer` tests from the behavior of `GiftCard`.  
  
If you look at `Customer#pay`, the only behavior of `#withdraw` we really care about 
is whether it returns a truthy value or falsy value, since that determines what happens next. 
This challenge guides you through building a single test case in which we construct a 
_test double_ for a gift card.  The `double` is an object that has no built-in behaviors,
so it must be given just enough behavior to be useful for this test case. 

We use `allow` to say "If the double gets a call to withdraw, it should return true". 
Similarly, if `#pay` is working correctly, the result of a successful withdrawal should be
a call to `Customer#notify` with a happy message.  Note that in this case, `Customer#notify`
hasn't even been implemented!  By saying that we expect to receive a call to it with a
particular argument, we basically "short-circuit" the real method call.  This further
isolates our test case from other methods, even those in `Customer` itself.

In this question, construct a test that verifies:
* a payment from a Customer has a giftcard with sufficient balance notifies the customer of the successful transaction
