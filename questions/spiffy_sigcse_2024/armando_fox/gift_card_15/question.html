# Before Part 2: simple tests for the Gift Card

The first tests you will write for a gift card behavior will test what
happens when a customer tries to use the gift card for a purchase.  If
the gift card balance is sufficient for the purchase (happy
path), the transaction should succeed and the gift card balance should
be reduced by the purchase amount.  If the balance is insufficient
(sad path), the transaction should fail and the gift card balance
should not change.

Which phase of the test
pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) contains each of the following elements of
the sad path test case?
