  <p>
    The goal of this exercise is for you to read and understand the purpose of
    the code shown below.  Your task is to describe the purpose of the code
    using plain language; your description will then be given to an AI language
    model, and the model will generate code matching your description.  You will
    have solved the exercise when the code generated by the AI model is
    functionally equivalent to the code you have described.
  </p>
 
  <p> 
    <i>
      Write a short, high-level English language description of the following
      function. Do not give a line-by-line description of the code.
    </i>
  </p>

<pl-code 
  language="c"
  prevent-select="true">
int foo(int values[], int length){

    int x = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (values[i] == 0) {
            x = i;
        }
    }

    return x;
}
</pl-code>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> The code generated by the AI model, based on your description,
  does not need to be identical to the code presented above. It simply needs to
  be functionally equivalent, but it may use a different approach.
